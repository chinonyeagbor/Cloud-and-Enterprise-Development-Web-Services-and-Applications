# Cloud-and-Enterprise-Development-Web-Services-and-Applications
This project demonstrates my ability to design, deploy, and consume web services and applications using contemporary cloud computing tools and technologies. Throughout the development process, I focused on creating highly scalable software solutions, evaluating cloud providers, and building distributed systems with a focus on web services. This work integrates the application of design patterns and principles that are essential for building enterprise-grade systems. It showcases my ability to design and implement a comprehensive Book Management System using MVC architecture, RESTful APIs, and SOAP services. The system supports full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, ensuring robust data handling and seamless communication between client and server. The project also demonstrates deployment to the cloud, connecting the application to a cloud database for scalability and reliability.

### Learning Outcomes 
Design and Implement Web Applications Using MVC Architecture
Built a modular and scalable web application using JavaScript with an MVC structure, allowing separation of concerns for efficient development and maintenance.

##### Develop and Consume RESTful APIs
Created a RESTful API to manage book records, supporting GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE operations with data formats including JSON, XML, and TEXT.

##### Create and Use SOAP Services
Generated a SOAP/WSDL service for managing books, ensuring compatibility with legacy systems and supporting CRUD operations.

##### Cloud Deployment and Integration
Deployed the application on the cloud, connecting it to a cloud database for real-time data access and scalability.

#### Critical Analysis and Report Writing
Conducted a thorough evaluation of the project, including system performance, cloud provider selection, and recommendations for future improvements.

### Key Features
##### Web Application
View Book Details: Fetch and display book records from the database.
Insert New Book: Add a new book to the system.
Update Existing Book: Modify details of an existing book.
Delete Book: Remove a book record from the system.

##### RESTful API
Fully implemented CRUD operations:
GET: Retrieve book details.
POST: Add new book records.
PUT: Update existing book data.
DELETE: Remove book records.
Supported data formats: JSON, XML, TEXT/STRING.

##### JavaScript Web Client
Built a dynamic web application using JavaScript and AJAX to interact with the RESTful API.
Provides full CRUD functionality:
View, insert, update, and delete book records.
Frameworks used: React JS for a seamless user interface.

##### Cloud Deployment
Deployed the web application to the cloud.
Connected the application to a Cloud Database for real-time, scalable data access.

##### SOAP Service
Generated a SOAP service for CRUD operations on the book database.
Built a test client to validate service functionality.

##### Critical Analysis
Provided a detailed report analyzing system design, cloud provider selection, and performance evaluation.
